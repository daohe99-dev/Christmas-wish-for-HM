# Photo uploads

Place your personal photos in this folder so they stay organized and easy to reference from the site configuration.

Suggested usage:
- Add your primary portrait photo (e.g., `primary.jpg`) here.
- Optionally add a few extras (e.g., `smile.jpg`, `winter-walk.png`) for a simple gallery later.
- Update `config.photo` in `script.js` to the filename you upload (for example, `assets/photos/primary.jpg`).

A placeholder heart image (`placeholder-heart.svg`) lives here so the page has a safe default until you add your own picture.
