# Photo uploads

Place your personal photos in this folder so they stay organized and easy to reference from the site configuration.

Suggested usage:
- Add your primary portrait photo (e.g., `Primary Picture.jpg`, `Primary Picture.png`, or `primary.jpg`) here.
- Optionally add a few extras (e.g., `Funny 1.jpg`, `winter-walk.png`) for the gallery.
- If you use different names, update the `filenames` lists in `config.photos` inside `script.js`—the script will try each filename (across `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`, `.webp` and both folders) and fall back to the heart placeholder if none are found.

A placeholder heart image (`placeholder-heart.svg`) lives here so the page has a safe default until you add your own picture.
